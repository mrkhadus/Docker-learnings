1. The code has the MongoDB connection within it which will fail as we don't have mongoDB installed
while creating the docker image, Comment out the MongoDB related code and now we will be able to 
spin the container.
Note: move the app.lsiten(3000) ==> out of the commented mongoDB code.

2. The code also has API requests made over the internet and to run that we need the access to the 
www from within the container ==> which we actually have without any special settings (out of the box)



~ docker build -t networking:www-access .

~ docker run -p 3001:3000 --name networking-access networking:www-access


#its fine if the code did not worked in your system, it is just to demonstrate that the 
app within the container is able to make api requests to the internet without any special settings

# If you wanted to try doing this by other method==> use the os image (any) with -it interactive terminal and ping google.com
Container OS will be able to ping google.com
