#We will setup the mongoDB container and our node app container and cross connect both

#1 we have mongo image available to use- 
# ~ docker run -d --name mongodb mongo

#2 --> Copy the IP address of the mongodb container (mine is 172.17.0.2)
# ~ docker inspect mongodb

#3 put this IP address instead of "host.docker.internal" in mongoDB address/URL in the node application code

#4 build and run docker container for the node app

#5 use postman to make api requests:
# get ==> localhost:3000/favorites
# post ==> localhost:3000/favorites ..etc
