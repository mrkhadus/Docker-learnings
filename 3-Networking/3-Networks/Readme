#We will setup the mongoDB container and our node app container and cross connect both

#1 Create a Network for the containers
# ~ docker network create myNet

#1 we have mongo image available to use- run it with the network created above
# ~ docker run -d --name mongodb --network myNet mongo

#2 --> Copy the IP address of the mongodb container (mine is 172.17.0.2)
#But here we need to just pass the name of the other container and IP resolution will be taken care by Docker using network.
# mongoose.connect(
    'mongodb://mongodb(container name):27017(port)/swfavorites',
    ....
) 
Save the code and build the image again and then run the container.

#5 use postman to make api requests:
# get ==> localhost:3000/favorites
# post ==> localhost:3000/favorites ..etc
