# Utility Containers:
==> containers other than the application containers, sometimes we need to use the enviornment which is not installed in our system- we can make use of the utility container. 
eg: we need to run node app, but our system is not configured to have node environment setup
We can provision the node container and run the required code in the container.

to run the utility containers:
# docker build -t node-util .
# docker run -it node-util npm install

If Entry point is used: Entry-point to restrict the use of any other command than the one mentioned.
* Add the ENTRYPOINT ["npm"] ,etc in order to run only command that starts with npm
# docker run -it node-util install  ==> no need to specify the npm docker will append command to the entrypoint automatically for us

# Docker Compose for the utility container

Create the docker compose yaml file and mention all the needed volumnes, base image, etc

* To run the docker-compose file for the utility container use cmd:
# docker-compose run 

* if we have multiple services in the compose file use-
# docker-compose run service-name eg: docker-compose run npm
