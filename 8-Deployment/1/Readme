Basic nodeJS app no db and nothing else.
It just has one image, one container and one app within 
# Deployment approach
1. SSH into the remote machine 
2. install docker 
3. push to repository and pull image
4. run container based on image on remote host

# Run and test the app
docker build -t node-dep .
docker run -d --rm --name node-deploy -p 80:80 node-dep
